# Solang Program Examples

It is not recommended to start on Solana with Solang. Refer to the [documentation](https://solana.com/docs) and Rust [program examples](https://github.com/solana-developers/program-examples) if you are just getting started and looking for program references.

The Solang examples in this repo are not guaranteed to run or be compatible with the latest versions of ecosystem tools. References exist here to achieve.
